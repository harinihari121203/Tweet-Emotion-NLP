# Tweet-Emotion-NLP
Predicting the emotion of tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

# Overview
This project predicts the emotion of tweets by analyzing their textual content. It employs NLP preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify tweets into different emotion categories.

# Features
Data Collection: Gather a dataset of tweets labeled with corresponding emotions.
Data Preprocessing: Clean, tokenize, and vectorize the tweet text for analysis.
Modeling: Build machine learning models to classify tweets into emotion categories.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

# Dataset
The dataset consists of tweets labeled with emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, and more. It is used for training and evaluating the emotion prediction models.

# Results
The models achieve accurate predictions, effectively categorizing tweets into different emotion classes.
